- [ ] Setup connection with these details:
  - **Host**: localhost
  - **Port**: 5112

  - **Username**: Aena
  - **Password**: Aenal123
- [ ] Click Connect → Should show: "Connection Success!" → Save

## 8. ✅ Design Database: Creating Database Models
- [x] Database structure designed for user management system

- [x] **projects.model.sql** created - Project management
- [x] **project_users.model.sql** created - Many-to-many relationship
- [x] **tasks.model.sql** created - Task management
- [x] **setup.sql** created - Master setup script with sample data
- [x] **setup.php** created - PHP script to execute database setup
- [x] **test_queries.php** created - Example queries and testing

### 🎯 Database Schema Summary:
```sql
users (id, username, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, role, timestamps)
projects (id, name, description, status, dates, created_by, timestamps)
project_users (project_id, user_id, role, joined_at) -- Junction table
tasks (id, title, description, status, priority, project_id, assigned_to, created_by, dates, timestamps)
```

### 🧪 Testing Results:
- ✅ Database setup completed successfully
- ✅ All tables created: users, projects, project_users, tasks
- ✅ Sample data inserted successfully
- ✅ Database queries working perfectly
- ✅ Foreign key relationships properly configured

## 🎉 Project Status: COMPLETED
All automated tasks have been completed successfully. The only remaining task is the manual database connection setup in VS Code's Database extension (Step 7).

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Connect to the database using VS Code's Database extension
2. Start building your application features
3. Use the sample queries in `database/test_queries.php` as reference
4. Modify the database schema as needed for your specific requirements
